            Our Country is facing today a vital cultural breakdown which is the outcome of invasion of western culture
            through electronic media. Kids and adolescents are the worst affected of it, since they are the soft and
            very easily flexible and adoptable to changes- either proper, or improper. Educational standard of our
            State, in particular, is not reflecting respectable heights. Success ratio of M.P. in national level exams-
            may it be civil or technical - is not so high. Certainly, there is no dearth of talent in the State, but
            what cut their success down are lack of proper environment, guidance and poverty. In big cities, there are
            certain institutes imparting good education, but they are out of reach of the poor people.
            In this context, the NEW HUMANISTIC EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY, MADHYA PRADESH was registered under madhya pradesh
            societies Registration Act 1973. The Society will be able to serve the people all over M.P. This institute
            is an off-shoot of the society.<br>
            The institute Bright Career Special Academy, Sagar aims at imparting high-Standard of education, inculcating
            love for our perennial cultural values to kids, and adolescents. A blending of oriental cultural, and
            occidental scientific outlook will reflect through the young ones, stepping into the institute. their all
            round development will be ensured through intensive academic sessions and extensive extra-curricular
            activities, like participation in N.C.C., Scout, Games and Sports, Painting, music, Seminars, Debates,
            Excursions etc. Fee structure is affordable, so as not to tax heavily upon the financially weaker people,
            probably constituting a larger section of our society. Wishing a <br>
            BRIGHT CAREER <br>
            To the youngsters</p>
